# Unity-Dots-WireframePlexusEffect
A Plexus like effect with connection-lines based on the wireframe of the mesh. Implemented with parallel running jobs and burst compile.

Had no idea how to implement this effect in Shadergraph or Effectgraph so i tried it with ecs/dots. 
A Mesh gets converted into WireaframePlexusObject.
